## Demo

http://jt.ms/juketube

## Purpose

When I attend parties, YouTube is often used as the sole music provider. People in turn launch the video they want to hear. The process goes as follows:

* open a new tab
* browse to YouTube
* search for a video
* open and instantly pause it (to preload it)
* wait for the current video to stop
* launch the new video

Several problems arise from this process:

* need to wait for the current video to stop before launching a new one
* need to permanently have someone queuing and launching a new video
* no automatic play, so if the current video ends, there's no music
* time spent queuing a new video
* tons of tabs opened

## Features

JukeTube is an attempt to simplify this scenario.

* Single page app
* Ajax search
* Playlists (upcoming and archived videos)
* Automatic play (as soon as the current video ends)

## Requirements

You only need a valid [YouTube Data API v3 key](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/) to copy-paste in **app.js**. (The current one only works on my domain).

The Gotham font is used on the demo site but is not provided. Try [Google Fonts](http://www.google.com/fonts) for some alternatives.

## Possible enhancements

* Play/Pause/Next/Previous controls (currently, only the state is shown).
* Use the YouTube API to retrieve the pre-populated video titles using the ID. Right now, the titles are hard-coded.
* Save the current playlist in LocalStorage or a cookie and restore it on the next visit (and add a `Clear playlist` button).
* Add drag controls to reorder the playlist items.
* Add search results pagination (the YouTube API provides a `pageToken` parameter).

@group Polymer Core Elements

The `core-theme-aware` element is a base element which can be 
extended to create elements that can support theming. This element applies
no styling itself; instead it allows the author to create styles that 
apply known themes.

The user of a theme-aware element can set a `theme` attribute anywhere 
in the dom tree containing the element, ShadowDOM inclusive. The theme-aware
element simply ensures that the element has the appropriate theme class. This
theme class corresponds to the theme attribute.

This means an author can create a set of elements that support a particular
theme, and the user of that set can, for example, set a theme attribute
on the body element to apply that theme inside the body element. The 
`core-theme-aware` element also supports nested theming. For example,
the body element might be given theme="standard" but a particuarly subtree
could be given a theme="different".

`core-theme-aware` uses the [Polymer.ThemeAware](#Polymer.ThemeAware) mixin.

Example:

    <body theme="pretty">

      <core-theme-aware> 
        auto-styled with class="pretty" as a result of the containing theme
      <core-theme-aware>

      <section theme="different">

        <core-theme-aware> 
          auto-styled with class="different" as a result of the containing theme
        <core-theme-aware>

      </section>

    </body>
